本项目起初是托管在新南威尔士大学私有的gitlab上，外界无法访问，所以我直接将成果转移到github上以供展示。在这个展示repo中，为了方便我并没有遵循git flow，而是直接上传了完整的代码。在原repo中，我严格遵循git flow进行开发。
The project was initially hosted on the private GitLab at the University of New South Wales, which was not accessible to the public. Therefore, I directly transferred the results to GitHub for display. In this showcase repository, for convenience, I did not follow Git flow but uploaded the complete code directly. In the original repository, I strictly followed Git flow for development.


This is a convenient bot that aims to help users from different time zones to communicate more smoothly.
